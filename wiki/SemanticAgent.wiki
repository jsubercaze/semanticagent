== Running the demo ==

During the demo, two agents named askAgent and answerAgent will communicate and answerAgent will send its behaviour composed of SWRL rules to askAgent.

The goal of the demo is to show how the agent interpreter is working. Each agent are of type: agent.core.swrlagent.SWRLAgent. The behaviours of the agents are *only* described in swrl:

* memory_init/answerBehaviour.swrl
* memory_init/askBehaviour.swrl

Behaviours are described are transition rules in an extended finite state machine
